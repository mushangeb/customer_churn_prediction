# Customer Churn Prediction 📉📊

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The notebook walks through the complete process of data analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **ChurnPrediction-Notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing all steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- **data/** (optional): Folder for storing the dataset used (if not loaded directly in the notebook).

## 🧠 Objectives

- Analyze customer data to understand features contributing to churn.
- Build a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn.
- Evaluate model performance and interpret the results.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning modeling and evaluation

## 🧪 Process Overview

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understanding data structure and identifying patterns.
   - Visualizations of key churn-related features.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values and categorical variables.
   - Feature scaling and transformation.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Model selection (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
   - Training and testing the model.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Confusion matrix and classification report.

5. **Interpretation & Insights**:
   - Feature importance analysis.
   - Business implications of model outputs.

## 🚀 How to Run the Codes

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` or install manually.
3. Open the notebook with Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ChurnPrediction-Notebook.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the results.

## 📌 Notes

- This is an educational project and can be extended with more advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning, ensemble models, or deep learning.
- Dataset source (if applicable) should be cited or included in a `/data` directory.

## 📈 Example Use Cases

- Telecom companies identifying customers at risk of churn.
- Subscription-based services planning retention strategies.
- Customer support teams targeting proactive outreach.
